# Hand-Stroke-Recognition
OpenCV and 1 dollar recognizers

The solution is simple and based on finding hand information from the depth images that were taken from a depth camera. 
Once the hand information is obtained then a pointer is located in the hand and tracked through the sequences resulting
in a path information that is fed to 1 dollar geometric recognizers to obtain the stroke type. 

The main.cpp contains all the code, in order to run it you will need depth image sequences.
